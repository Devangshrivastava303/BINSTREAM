                                <p>The "Pirate King," Gol D. Roger, was renowned as the mightiest and most infamous

                                    subsequent execution of Roger prompted a global shift. His final words disclosed the
                                    existence of One Piece, the greatest treasure in the world. As a result, the Grand
                                    Age of Pirates emerged, with swashbucklers yearning for One Piece's vast riches,
                                    fame, and the vaunted title of Pirate King. Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old atypical
                                    pirate, enters the fray. Unlike the stereotypical marauder—grizzled, wicked, and
                                    ruthless—Luffy seeks pure adventure, relishing the prospect of meeting diverse
                                    characters, embarking on wild escapades, and ultimately obtaining the promised
                                    treasure. Inspired by his childhood idol, Luffy and his team navigate the Grand
                                    Line, encountering strange phenomena, unraveling enigmatic puzzles, and battling
                                    formidable foes in their quest for One Piece, the most coveted of all treasures.

                                    tails, launched a devastating attack on the Hidden Leaf Village, Konohagakure. The

                                <p>A decade ago, "the Gate" emerged and linked the real world with the supernatural
                                    realm. Superhuman powers were bestowed upon ordinary individuals, allowing them to
                                    become "Hunters" who battled against malicious creatures. Sung Jin-Woo, a Hunter at
                                    the age of twenty, was deemed the "World's Weakest" due to his pitiful strength,
                                    even weaker than an E-Rank Hunter. However, he persevered by tirelessly hunting
                                    monsters in low-rank Gates to pay for his mother's medical expenses. Yet, Jin-Woo's
                                    dismal existence takes a sharp turn when he wakes up in a hospital three days after
                                    a botched mission where he thought he was the last to perish. To his surprise, he
                                    sees a strange screen floating before him called the "Quest Log." It requires him to
                                    complete a daunting and unrealistic training program or risk facing dire
                                    consequences. At first hesitant due to the severity of the task, Jin-Woo soon
                                    realizes that it may be his chance to become one of the world's most formidable
                                    Hunters.
